Google Ottawa HTML5 Extension
=============================

Prepared for our January 29th, 2010 Hackathon in Ottawa. Which acts as a 
notification center. Users in the hackathon can install this extension which
connects it self to the external server using Web Sockets. You can chat
with the attendees, and the staff can send notifications to everyone.

Implemented using HTML5 technologies:

 * WebSockets
 * CSS3 Transformations, Gradients, Borders, Box Shadows, Animations, etc
 * Local Storage
 * Notifications

Bundled in a Google Chrome Extension for easy web installation, and the server
uses NodeJS that runs the WebSocket mini-server.
